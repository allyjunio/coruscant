# Coruscant 

This repo contain the three projects we've created for the f8hackathon.

These projects is divided in:

1. [api project](api)
    - Project to expose the model as an API
2. [coruscant-web project](coruscant-web)
    - GUI to prove user friendly access to the model.
3. [deep learning project](deep_learning)
    - Deep learning model used by the API to identify offensive language patterns


Please view the README.MD files in each of these project for guidance on how to use them.
