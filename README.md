# Coruscant 

This repo contain the three projects we've created for the f8hackathon.

These projects is divided in:

1. [api project](api)
    - Project to expose the model as an API
2. [coruscant-web project](coruscant-web)
    - GUI to prove user friendly access to the model.
3. [deep learning project](deep_learning)
    - Deep learning model used by the API to identify offensive language patterns


Please view the README.MD files in each of these project for guidance on how to use them.

The following image explains how Coruscant would work as a Facebook feature, and our plans for future iterations:
