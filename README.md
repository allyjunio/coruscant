# Coruscant 

This repo contain the three projects we've created for the f8hackaton.

These projects is divided in:

1. [api project](api)
    - Project to expose the model as api
2. [coruscan-web project](coruscan-web)
    - GUI to prove user friendly access to the model.
3. [deep learning project](deep_learning)
    - Project to train and save the deep learning model to be uses by the api


Each one off these project has guidance how to use them in their readmes files.
